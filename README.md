Stores my Udacity coursework and raw project files.

## Overview

I started the Udacity full stack nano-degree program, and at first was pretty into it.
The material was elementary, but the production was good, and it gave me some coherent
goals to refresh my skills and work in Python, which I hadn't done seriously, or in a while.

I became disenfranchised with the program around the end of the trial period.  Despite the extremely high production value, I found the information and presentation to be somewhat low-level, and it frequently forced me to lie, in order to move beyond prompts to participate in ungraded low-level group discussions / screenshot sharing.  

While the value of these points is debatable, and I'd be willing to look past them, two points in particular made me decide it would not be worth my money in the future:

* Grading on my initial project took two weeks.  
  
  The student handbook notes this is the expected timeframe, but I didn't see it until after I became concerned and started investigating.  Since the information is freely available, and rather elementary, the key service I was paying for was verification of my efforts and comprehension by actual staff.  I considered this far too long considering the premium cost.  
  
  For comparison, my Coursera projects were graded immediately (automatic) or within a week (peer review).  The cost of the course was also less, and the modules were more comprehensive; e.g. I found the Scala course ($100/9-weeks) covered more advanced material than the entire Udacity nano-degree program ($300/month; 2 month minimum).  To be fair, the production quality and deliverables were less refined on Coursera, and I only performed a cursory review of later Udacity modules.  
  
  Another point of comparison is my community college courses in the [VCCS](http://www.vccs.edu/ "Virginia Community College System"), which cost less for a semester than the Udacity program, and felt more comprehensive by the end, despite being slower paced.

  My interpretation is that Udacity only verifies an extremely novice level of skill at an uncompetitive cost.
  
* I found the billing system to be dysfunctional and hostile.

  The initial credit card used to sign up turned out to be over it's limit.  I had borrowed this card from a parent, because I wouldn't have the money myself for several weeks.  The system would not let me remove the card while I was enrolled.  The only options I had were to cancel my enrollement or change my card.  I cancelled my enrolment, and was told I would be unenrolled at the end of the billing period.  I was not allowed to cancel my cancel.  At this point my only option was to change my card.
  
  Despite email complaints and request for removal of the service, the system continued to attempt to charge the card every few days.  If I had used a debit card, I would have incurred hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees, a point I noted in my email complaint.  I maintain, as I suggested in my email, that considering the potential for crippling financial effects, holding invalid payment data hostage like this is unethical.   
  
  At this point, I had resigned to quit the program, and was worried that my parents would be charged when they payed off their card.  I finally swapped the number with a ten dollar prepaid card, to prevent further charge attempts from being a liability.

## Review Synopsis.

Based on my experience, I can't recommend Udacity to anyone serious about advancing their comprehension of programming.  I found the material and group participation exercises to be extremely novice, and the company seemed more interested with PR articles and flashy presentation than actually developing complex skills, or properly fleshing out their administrative / grading / billing services.  I could excuse all of these things if the program was dirt cheap, but based on my experience and goals, it was radically overpriced.

For parents or young students looking for a well produced introduction at a premium rate, the program does provide a reasonable introduction to programming and database concepts.  The program is also structured in such a way that basic team and application development skills are included, that are often missing from the traditional academic approach (which tends to be more about theory than application).

I would not hire someone based on their completion of this program alone.
